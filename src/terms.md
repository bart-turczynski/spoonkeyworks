These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Reddit Answers Saver browser extension (“Extension”). By installing or using the Extension, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not install or use the Extension.

## 1. Description of the Extension

## 2. License

The Extension is provided under the open-source license specified in the project repository. Subject to these Terms, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the Extension for personal or internal business purposes.

## 3. User Responsibilities

- Ensure your use of the Extension complies with applicable laws, regulations, and policies, including Reddit’s terms and API rules.
- Do not use the Extension to collect or distribute content in a manner that violates intellectual property rights or privacy rights.
- You are solely responsible for the JSON files exported by the Extension and any subsequent storage, processing, or sharing of that data.

## 4. Data Handling

- The Extension operates entirely in your browser and sends no data to the Extension publisher.
- Any information captured from Reddit Answers pages is stored only in the JSON file that is downloaded to your device.
- You are responsible for safeguarding and deleting the exported files.
