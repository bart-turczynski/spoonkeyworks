# Reddit Answers Chrome Extension

Reddit Answers Chrome Extension allows Redditors to collect answers to questions asked in Reddit's AI chatbot-like interface. See the [privacy policy](/reddit-answers/privacy/) and [terms of service](/reddit-answers/terms/) for more.

Note: Reddit Answers Chrome Extension is not affiliated with Reddit. It's a tool created by a fan of reddit.com. The extension does a very specific thing on Reddit, and it's not easy to call it anything meaningful without using this brand's name. If you work at Reddit or otherwise represent the company, please don't be angry with me.
